### Lab 1

To execute Go binary file, you need to set the executable permission on the binary file first.

```bash
./lab1
```

Fo testing the server, you can use curl command.

```bash
curl -v localhost:8080/index.html
curl -v localhost:8080/about.html
```

Or you can use browser to access the server.
